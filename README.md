# CS 175 Final Project: Analysis of COVID-19 Infection Rates and Weather Patterns

Team: Jose Maldonado, Nomin Amgalan, Joshua Si

## Running Code:

Make sure [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed

To ensure all requirements are installed, run:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

To run our sample source, open predictingCases.py:
```python3 predictingCases```

Proceed to enter input, and it will return predictions on COVID-19 growth rates using our Neural Network and Linear Regression models.
